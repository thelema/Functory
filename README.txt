This is Functory mini tutorial.

Installation
============

	./configure

	make

	sudo make install


Usage
=====

Assume you want to apply a function "map" such as

  let map x = x+1

to some list elements such as 

  [1;2;3;4;5]

and sum the results with a function "fold" such as

  let fold = (+)

You can do that using function "map_local_fold" from the library, as follows:

  let () = Printf.printf "%d@." (map_local_fold ~map ~fold 0 [1;2;3;4;5])


The Functory library allows you to perform this computation in three
different ways: either sequentially, or using several cores on the
same machine, or using a network of different machines.

To use the sequential implementation, you simply use the following
line of code

  open Functory.Sequential

To use several cores (say 4) on a single machine, you should add
instead

  open Functory.Cores
  let () = set_number_of_cores 4

Finally, to use a network of, say 2 cores on machine "mach1" and 4
cores on machine "mach2", you should add instead

  open Functory.Network
  let () = declare_workers ~n:2 "mach1"
  let () = declare_workers ~n:4 "mach2"

Your program is compiled in the following way (in any case):

	ocamlopt -I +functory unix.cmxa functory.cmxa <your files...>

and then run as usual. In the network case, the same program should be
run on the three machines, that are the two workers and the master. 
(It is also possible to run different programs for master and workers;
see the documentation).
